# Advent of Code 2018 - in Kotlin!

I'm going to attempt (likely with varying degrees of motivation) to implement all of the advent of code problems in Kotlin.

## Running the code

I've included the input file supplied by advent of code for each problem. The solution to the first part of the problem is usually commented out in the solution.kt file. If the solution to the fisrt part was really long, and I wasn't lazy, then there will be a solution1.kt and a solution2.kt. I've also included the resulting jar files so that they can be run in a java 10 environment

```
   java -jar solution.jar input
```
